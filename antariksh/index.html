Since 2014, we have been studying the earth's geological changes and came to the conclusion
that the earth's condition is declining at a rapid rate and that there is no more time left 
for 'Save the Earth' campaigns or any other laws protecting the earth. What could we possibly 
do then? Look for a new home. In 2015 Antariksh launched its very own satellite, namely, 
BrahmaKhoj into space, after 2 years, In September 2017 we found our new home, planet C-137
a planet identical to earth, or should we say better.

In 2 months time we will start taking people who have invested in this journey of survival.
The cost is heavy, ofcourse(it's SPACE TRAVEL),but in return we are giving you the gift of life!
You will be getting a lot of equipment to ensure your safety during your journey to C-137.Our 
satellite 'BrahmaKhoj' will be providing you all the details about the planet's schematics(weather forecast, duration of day/night, updated calendar etc).
Starting a new life on a new planet will be very difficult but we will help.

        The rocket is tested and is 100% safe.
        <br><br>
        Each rocket is manned by 2 professional Astronauts who have 5+ years
        experience to ensure a proper deplyoment and  a less turbulent orbital traverse.
        <br><br>
        There is a  ground team of 15 people to make sure that your path is clear of any 
        celestial obstacles.
        <br><br>
        The steel used to manufacture the rocket is of high-grade quality and is resistant to 
        most types of wear & tear. The rocket goes through 3 rounds of extremely vigilant inspection
        to make sure that there are no leaks in the metallic framework.
